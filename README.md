# Otafu

## Overview

Otafu is an innovative platform that allows users to engage with prediction markets without risking their own funds. Unlike traditional and current Web3 prediction markets, Otafu aims to leverage the strengths of decentralized finance (DeFi) to create a superior experience. By integrating DeFi mechanisms, particularly through Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) and Liquid Staking Tokens (LST), we aim to enhance the prediction market landscape significantly.

## Features

- **No Risk Participation**: Users can pick and play without losing a cent.
- **DeFi Integration**: Utilizes DeFi protocols to boost winnings and offer cashback.
- **Dynamic Prize Pool**: A portion of the prize pool is staked in LSD/LST, generating yield for user benefits.
- **Account Marketplace**: Users can sell accounts with varying boosted winnings and cashback.
- **Points System**: Bootstrap network effects to determine $OTA airdrops for further decentralization.
- **$OTA Governance Token**: The future of the protocol will be shaped by $OTA holders.
- **Money Market Development**: Future features will allow users to leverage bets across multiple prediction markets.
- **Mobile-First Platform**: Transitioning to a mobile app to enhance user accessibility.
